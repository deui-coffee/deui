  "notes": "For medium to dark roasted beans. Produced a complex espresso meant for sipping, not for mixing with milk. The low starting temperature of 82C--which declines to 72C--is the magic.  This creates a silky, textured shot with good aroma, pleasant acidity, great complexity, and no off flavors. There are two styles: a ristretto or a double shot.  With a ristretto, put the recommended dose weight (ie, 14g, 15g, 18g, 20g) into the basket, and pull it as a 1:1 ratio shot.  For a double shot, updose by 10% to 20% and extract to a 2:1 ratio (and grind a bit coarser).  With both approaches, immediately after preinfusion aim for a flow rate in the range of 0.5-1.2ml\/sec. The darker the roast, the slower the recommended flow rate. The ristretto has more flavor and complexity while the overdosed double shot is very smooth, easy to drink, and classic.",
